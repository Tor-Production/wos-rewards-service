# Architecture — Configuration and environment

- **Parent:** [architecture.md](../architecture.md) — overview, component map, cross-cutting
  invariants, phased implementation order, and the [traceability map](../architecture.md#traceability-map).
- **Status:** Draft. Variable and secret **names only**; the authoritative list for every stack.

> Evidence tags carry the same meaning as in the overview: **[fact:<ref>]** (confirmed by an
> official page listed in [architecture.md §25](../architecture.md#25-official-sources)),
> **[inference]** (a design conclusion drawn from those facts), **[assumption]** (needs a spike
> or human decision).

## 4. Configuration and environment

Variable **names only** — no values appear in this repository. Values are supplied per
stack via Wrangler vars (non-secret) and Wrangler secrets (secret).

### Non-secret configuration

| Name | Read by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ENVIRONMENT` | all | `staging` or `production`; selects the stack |
| `DISCORD_REGISTRATION_CHANNEL_ID` | ingestion tier, ingestion Worker | the only channel whose messages are registration commands |
| `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` | ingestion tier, ingestion Worker | expected guild |
| `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID` | ingestion Worker, output builder | own application id; used by the author filter |
| `DEFAULT_STATE` | registration parser | state used when the message omits a numeric state (contract in `AGENTS.md`) |
| `DISCORD_MESSAGE_MAX_LENGTH` | output builder | chunking threshold (defaults to the Discord limit) |
| `OPERATION_DEADLINE_SECONDS` | consumers, sweeper | max wall time before an operation is force-closed with a partial summary |
| `ITEM_CLAIM_LEASE_SECONDS` | consumers, sweeper | `operation_items` lease TTL |
| `REDEMPTION_CLAIM_LEASE_SECONDS` | consumers, sweeper | **invocation** lease TTL (`redemptions.invocation_expires_at`); also the `retry_wait` "must be re-picked-up by" grace. **Set above the provider call timeout** so a lease does not expire mid-call ([§15.2](redemption-state-machine.md#152-global-redemption-record--the-sole-provider-call-authority)) |
| `OUTPUT_CLAIM_LEASE_SECONDS` | output dispatcher, sweeper | `discord_output_deliveries` claim lease TTL |
| `FANOUT_EXPANSION_PAGE_SIZE` | fan-out expansion worker | rows per bounded expansion page |
| `SWEEPER_REDRIVE_BATCH` | operation sweeper | max stuck `(player_id, code)` pairs re-driven per sweeper run |
| `REDEMPTION_MAX_REEVAL` | ingestion Worker, sweeper, repair | cap on `redemptions.reeval_count`; beyond it only an operator `repair_run` may reopen the row |
| `REDEMPTION_AUTO_REOPEN_RETRY_EXHAUSTED` | operation sweeper | default `false`; when `true`, the sweeper may reopen a `retry_exhausted` global row once per cooldown (bounded by `REDEMPTION_MAX_REEVAL`) |
| `SUMMARY_BUILD_PAGE_SIZE` | summary builder | `operation_items` per layout page / chunks per render page |
| `SUMMARY_MAX_CHUNKS` | summary builder | hard cap on chunks per summary; overflow becomes a deterministic `"+N more not listed"` line in the final chunk |
| `OUTBOX_DISPATCH_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | outbox dispatcher | attempts before an outbox row is marked `dead` |
| `OUTPUT_DISPATCH_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | output dispatcher | send attempts before a delivery row is alerted |
| `CODE_DISCOVERY_ENABLED` | code-discovery scheduler | master switch; `false` until a source is authorized |
| `PRODUCTION_REDEMPTION_ENABLED` | provider adapter | must be `false` unless an authorized provider is documented and approved |
| `PROVIDER_MODE` | provider adapter | `mock` (default) or a named authorized provider |
| `REGISTRATION_JOBS_QUEUE` / `CODE_FANOUT_JOBS_QUEUE` / `REDEMPTION_DLQ_QUEUE` | producers/consumers | queue bindings |
| `PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES` | consumers | retry cap for retryable provider failures (≤ Queues max, [fact:C8]) |
| `PROVIDER_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND` | provider adapter | client-side rate limiting toward the provider |
| `SPIKE_SENDER_ALLOWLIST` | `DiscordEventSource` **and** ingestion Worker (**staging only**) | dedicated spike bot/webhook sender ids; the source forwards them instead of dropping them, the Worker re-checks the same list as the authoritative gate; never set in the production config of either tier |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | all | structured-log verbosity |

### Secrets (names only — never values, never logged)

| Name | Held by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | ingestion tier, output dispatcher | Discord bot authentication |
| `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` | interactions fallback only | Ed25519 verification for the `/register` fallback ([ADR 0001](../adr/0001-discord-event-ingestion.md) Option 3) |
| `INGESTION_SHARED_SECRET` | companion (Option 2), ingestion Worker | authenticates companion → `/ingest` |

**No production Whiteout provider secret is defined.** A future authorized provider may use
any authentication mechanism; its secret name(s) are added only when its contract is
documented and approved. Any `WHITEOUT_PROVIDER_*` name that appears later is a non-binding
placeholder, not a commitment to API-key authentication.
